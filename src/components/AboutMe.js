            Hello! My name is Marcia. First, I want to commend you on this huge step you have taken towards a better quality of life. Seeking help is never easy but you have taken the first step towards improving your life and making positive changes.

I have worked with diverse clients in various settings experiencing a variety of life challenges including: mental health issues, relationship issues, family conflict / dynamics, stress management, death, dying and bereavement, and more.

            Though, my experience is varied, I believe what sets me apart is my ability to use my gift of insight and compassion in conjunction with my academic accomplishments and experience to support client.

Ultimately, I am focused on helping my clients work towards positive and progressive change and reset the course to a better and healthier life.
